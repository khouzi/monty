This project is a part of the curriculum of software engineering for the monty module at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/tn/en/ "Holberton School").

## Description

The project is a Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO practice.


###  Compilation

Our code will be compiled this way:

`$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c90 *.c -o monty`

And it has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in a VirtualBox on it via Vagrant(2.2.14) using the Betty style.

###  Usage

To use our code you simply need to:

- Clone the repository

`$ git clone https://github.com/khouzi/monty.git`


-   Change directory to monty

`$ cd monty/`

-  Compile with the following:

`$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c90 *.c -o monty`

-  Once compiled, to start the program, run:

`$ ./monty`

-  To exit the program, run:

`$ Ctrl+D`
